Example Summary
----------------
This example is intended to be a starting point for new development where
a minimal footprint is needed.

Peripherals Exercised
---------------------
Board_LED0  Indicates that the board was initialized within main()

Example Usage
-------------
The example lights Board_LED0 as part of the initialization in main().
Then a heartBeat task toggles the LED at a rate determined by the arg0 parameter
for the constructed Task instance in the .c file.

Application Design Details
--------------------------
This examples is the same as the "Empty" example except many development
and debug features have been removed. For example:
    - No logging is enabled
    - No assert checking is enabled
    - No Kernel Idle task
    - Non-Instrumented driver modules are used
    - No stack overflow checking

Please refer to the "Memory Footprint Reduction" section in the TI-RTOS User
Guide (spruhd4.pdf) for a complete and detailed list of the differences
between the empty minimal and empty projects.
